# TAB 1 — GENERAL: Project Overview

## What is Competzy?

Competzy is Indonesia's unified K-12 academic competition platform. It replaces a fragmented ecosystem where every competition (EMC, ISPO, OSEBI, Komodo, Owlypia, etc.) had its own separate website, login, and payment system. Students had to manage dozens of accounts across different platforms.

Competzy brings everything into one place:
- **Students** discover and register for competitions, pay, and track their results
- **Parents** monitor their children's registrations and pay on their behalf
- **Organizers** create competitions, review participants, and manage payouts
- **Schools** register students in bulk and pay as an institution
- **Country Reps** manage regional schools and consolidate payments
- **Referrals** promote competitions and earn commissions
- **Admins** operate the full platform

---

## Historical Data (from Excel database)

This is real competition data from previous years that will be imported into Competzy so past participants can claim their history.

| Dataset | Count | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Total student-competition records | 63,365 | Across 54 competitions |
| Unique students (by email) | ~47,976 | ~8,188 registered for multiple competitions |
| Competitions | 54 | EMC, ISPO, OSEBI, Komodo, Owlypia, STEM Olympiad, Webinars |
| Schools | 21,144 | 19,371 from Indonesia + international |
| Parents linked | 29,321 | Already linked to students |
| Supervisors (teachers) | 28,918 | Guru, Dosen, Pembina |
| PAID students | 55,400 (87.4%) | Already paid in past |
| UNPAID students | 7,916 (12.5%) | Registered but never paid |
| Gold medals | 358 | |
| Silver medals | 649 | |
| Bronze medals | 982 | |
| Honorable Mentions | 1,341 | |
| Finalists (PASSED) | 26,007 | |

**Key challenge:** The Excel data has NO NISN numbers. Identity matching must be done via email (88.6% coverage) + WhatsApp (96.9% coverage) + name + school.

## Platform Architecture

```
competzy/
├── app/        React Native (Expo) — mobile app
│               Roles: Student, Parent, Teacher (light)
│
├── web/        Next.js 14 — web portals
│               Roles: Admin, Organizer, School, Country Rep, Referral
│
└── backend/    Express.js + PostgreSQL — shared backend
                Single API for both app and web
                Port 3000 (dev)
```

**All three share one database. There is no separate backend for the web.**

# TAB 2 — YOUR TASKS (Mobile App + Backend)

**Your role:** You own the mobile app (React Native/Expo) and the shared backend (Express/PostgreSQL).
Write the API contracts for any endpoint your teammate needs, then build them. Your teammate calls your APIs.

**How to use this table:** Change the Status cell as you work.
- `☐ To Do` → `⏳ In Progress` → `✅ Done`

---

## 🔴 CRITICAL — Must finish before Phase 1 (July 10)

| # | Task | Details | File(s) | Priority | Status |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Fix file storage: local disk → S3/MinIO | Local `/uploads/` will be wiped on any server restart or redeployment. Set up MinIO on your VPS and migrate multer to use S3 SDK. Affects: payment proof, documents, profile photos. | `backend/src/services/storage.service.ts`, `payments.routes.ts`, `documents.routes.ts` | 🔴 Critical | ☐ To Do |
| 2 | Add `registration_number` to registrations | Generate human-readable IDs like `KMP-2026-00001` using a DB sequence. Shown on receipts, WA messages, and participant exports. | `backend/migrations/` (new), `backend/src/routes/registrations.routes.ts` | 🔴 Critical | ☐ To Do |
| 3 | Add `profile_snapshot` to registrations | When a student registers, snapshot their name/school/grade/NISN into a JSONB column. Prevents profile edits from changing historical registration data. | `backend/migrations/` (new), `backend/src/routes/registrations.routes.ts` | 🔴 Critical | ☐ To Do |
| 4 | Fix quota race condition in bulk processor | Currently two bulk jobs running at same time can both read quota=50 and both insert 30 students (total 60, exceeding quota). Fix: `UPDATE competitions SET quota = quota - 1 WHERE id = $1 AND quota > 0 RETURNING quota`. If 0 rows returned: quota exceeded, fail this row. | `backend/src/services/bulk-processor.service.ts` | 🔴 Critical | ☐ To Do |
| 5 | Build backend organizer routes | Your teammate builds the organizer portal UI. You build the API. See the "API Contract" section below for the exact endpoints needed. | `backend/src/routes/organizer.routes.ts` (new file) | 🔴 Critical | ☐ To Do |
| 6 | Add `organizer` role to backend auth | Update the role enum in users table to include `organizer`. Update `POST /api/auth/signup` to handle organizer role data (org name, logo, PIC, bank account). Add `organizerOnly` middleware. | `backend/migrations/` (new), `backend/src/middleware/`, `backend/src/routes/auth.routes.ts` | 🔴 Critical | ☐ To Do |
| 7 | Post-payment JWT redirect endpoint | After Midtrans `settlement` webhook fires for internal competitions (EMC, ISPO, OSEBI, Komodo): generate a signed JWT and include a redirect URL in the webhook response. JWT payload: `{ registration_id, competition_id, student_name, payment_status: 'paid', paid_at, expires_at (24h) }`. | `backend/src/routes/payments.routes.ts`, `backend/src/services/midtrans.service.ts` | 🔴 Critical | ☐ To Do |
| 8 | Rebrand app: "Beyond Classroom" → "Kompetix" → "Competzy" (final, May 8, 2026) | Update `app.json` (name, slug, scheme), splash screen text, and any hardcoded strings in the app. | `app/app.json`, any screen with prior brand text | 🔴 Critical | ✅ Done |
| 9 | Remove admin screens from mobile app | Admin work moves to the web. Remove admin tabs/screens from the mobile app's `_layout.tsx` tab routing. Admin users on mobile should see a message: "Use the web portal at admin.competzy.com". | `app/app/(tabs)/_layout.tsx`, `app/app/(tabs)/admin-*.tsx` | 🔴 Critical | ☐ To Do |
| 10 | Mobile: Show registration number on cards | After adding `registration_number` to backend, update the mobile registration list and detail screens to display it prominently (e.g. `KMP-2026-00001`). | `app/app/(tabs)/my-competitions.tsx`, `app/app/(tabs)/my-registration-details.tsx` | 🔴 Critical | ☐ To Do |

---

## 🟠 HIGH — Phase 1, finish before launch

| # | Task | Details | File(s) | Priority | Status |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 11 | Historical data import script | Write a Node.js/Python script that reads the Excel file and imports it into a new `historical_participants` table. Steps: (1) normalize WhatsApp numbers, (2) map school_ext_id to schools table, (3) normalize payment_method values, (4) deduplicate 420 exact (email, comp_id) pairs, (5) bulk INSERT. | `backend/src/db/import-historical.ts` (new), `backend/migrations/` (new schema) | 🟠 High | ☐ To Do |
| 12 | Create `historical_participants` DB schema | New table: `id, ext_student_id, name, email, grade, gender, school_ext_id, school_name, comp_ext_id, comp_name, comp_year, whatsapp, payment_status, participant_type, finalist_result, winner_medal, linked_user_id, link_method, link_confidence, linked_at, claim_status`. | `backend/migrations/` (new) | 🟠 High | ☐ To Do |
| 13 | Auto-link historical records at login | In `GET /api/auth/me`: after fetching the user, run `UPDATE historical_participants SET linked_user_id=userId, link_method='email', link_confidence=95 WHERE email=user.email AND linked_user_id IS NULL`. Same for phone after OTP verification. This is transparent to the user. | `backend/src/routes/auth.routes.ts` | 🟠 High | ☐ To Do |
| 14 | Build claim system API | Endpoints: `GET /api/historical/suggestions` (returns unlinked records matching user's name+school), `POST /api/historical/claim` (submit a claim, confidence scoring), `GET /api/historical/my-records` (return linked records for current user), `GET /api/admin/historical/claims` (admin review queue). | `backend/src/routes/historical.routes.ts` (new) | 🟠 High | ☐ To Do |
| 15 | Mobile: Historical claims UI | New screen in student profile tab: "Riwayat Kompetisi". Shows auto-linked records and potential matches. User can claim a record → triggers `POST /api/historical/claim`. Show medal badges (🥇🥈🥉) and PASSED/FAILED finalist results. | `app/app/(tabs)/profile/history.tsx` (new) | 🟠 High | ☐ To Do |
| 16 | Mobile: Competition post-payment redirect | After successful payment, if competition is "internal type" (EMC, ISPO, OSEBI, Komodo), show a "Go to competition platform" button that opens the redirect URL with the signed JWT token. | `app/app/(tabs)/my-registration-details.tsx` | 🟠 High | ☐ To Do |
| 17 | Bulk processor: concurrent job support | Replace `SELECT ... WHERE status='pending' LIMIT 1` with `SELECT ... FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED LIMIT 1` so multiple workers can process jobs simultaneously without conflicts. Prevents queue starvation with large CSV uploads. | `backend/src/services/bulk-processor.service.ts` | 🟠 High | ☐ To Do |
| 18 | VA expiry handling in payment webhook | When Midtrans sends `expire` status: reset `registration.status` back to `registered` (not deleted) so the student can pay again. Currently it just marks payment as `expired` but leaves the registration in limbo. | `backend/src/routes/payments.routes.ts` (webhook handler) | 🟠 High | ☐ To Do |

---

## 🟡 MEDIUM — Phase 2 (School Portal, ~August)

| # | Task | Details | File(s) | Priority | Status |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 19 | Create `school_payment_batches` DB table | New table for school bulk payments: `id, school_user_id, comp_id, registration_ids[], total_amount, status, midtrans_order_id, snap_token, expires_at, paid_at`. Allows school to pay for all students in one transaction. | `backend/migrations/` (new) | 🟡 Medium | ✅ Done (T23 — `1746300000000_school-payment-batches.sql`, also adds `school_payment_batch_items`) |
| 20 | Build bulk payment endpoint | `POST /api/payments/school-batch`: takes `{ registrationIds[] }`, validates registrations belong to school, creates Snap token for total, persists batch + items. | `backend/src/routes/payments.routes.ts` | 🟡 Medium | ✅ Done (T23) |
| 21 | Mobile teacher: "Pay All" button | In teacher actions screen, after bulk registration completes: show a "Pay for all students" button that triggers the bulk payment flow. Shows breakdown: X students × Rp Y = Rp Z. | `app/app/(tabs)/teacher-actions.tsx` | 🟡 Medium | ☐ To Do |
| 22 | Mobile teacher: per-student payment status | In the teacher's student list, add a payment status column so they can see which students have paid vs. still pending. Color-coded: green=paid, yellow=pending, red=expired. | `app/app/(tabs)/teacher-students.tsx` | 🟡 Medium | ☐ To Do |
| 23 | Mobile teacher: remove heavy ops | Move bulk CSV upload out of mobile into a "use web portal" message. Keep lightweight views: student list, registration status, analytics. Heavy ops (CSV upload, bulk pay) belong on web. | `app/app/(tabs)/teacher-actions.tsx` | 🟡 Medium | ☐ To Do |
| 24 | Backend: add `referral_code` to registrations | Add `referral_code TEXT` column to `registrations` table. Set from cookie/query param when student registers. Needed for Phase 3 referral system. Add it now so data isn't lost retroactively. | `backend/migrations/` (new), `backend/src/routes/registrations.routes.ts` | 🟡 Medium | ✅ Done (T24 — `1746400000000_add-referral-code.sql`, captured in POST /api/registrations body) |
| 25 | Add admin refund endpoint | `POST /api/admin/payments/:id/refund`: calls Midtrans refund API, records refund transaction, updates registration status to `refunded`. | `backend/src/routes/admin.routes.ts` | 🟡 Medium | ✅ Done (T25 — refundPayment() in midtrans.service.ts + endpoint in admin.routes.ts) |

## 🟢 LOW — Improvements & Polish

| # | Task | Details | File(s) | Priority | Status |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 26 | Mobile: Parent can pay for child | Parent sees child's unpaid registration → taps "Pay" → goes through full Midtrans payment flow, but payment is attributed to child's registration. Currently this button exists in the UI but needs backend validation that parent is actually linked to that student. | `backend/src/routes/payments.routes.ts`, `app/app/(tabs)/children.tsx` | 🟢 Low | ☐ To Do |
| 27 | Mobile: Competition detail — use profile snapshot | On the registration detail screen, display data from `profile_snapshot` (what was submitted) instead of the live user profile. Shows exactly what the organizer sees. | `app/app/(tabs)/my-registration-details.tsx` | 🟢 Low | ☐ To Do |
| 28 | Add WA notification after payment | After Midtrans `settlement`: send a WhatsApp message (via Twilio or Fonnte) to student and parent: "Your registration for [Competition] is confirmed. Registration number: KMP-2026-XXXXX." | `backend/src/routes/payments.routes.ts` (webhook) | 🟢 Low | ☐ To Do |
| 29 | Backend: drop orphaned `parent_school_id` columns | `students.parent_school_id` and `parents.parent_school_id` are leftover from an earlier design. The system now uses `parent_student_links`. Drop these columns in a migration to avoid confusion. | `backend/migrations/` (new) | 🟢 Low | ☐ To Do |
| 30 | Backend: competition `slug` field | Add `slug TEXT UNIQUE` to competitions table (e.g. `emc-2026-main`). Used in web URLs for SEO. Generate from name+year on create. | `backend/migrations/` (new), `backend/src/routes/admin.routes.ts` | 🟢 Low | ☐ To Do |

# TAB 3 — TEAMMATE TASKS (Web Portals)

**Your role:** You own the web platform (Next.js 14). You call the backend APIs — you never touch the database directly. When you need a new API endpoint, ask your partner to build it (see the API Contract table in Tab 2).

**How to use this table:** Change the Status cell as you work.
- `☐ To Do` → `⏳ In Progress` → `✅ Done`

---

## Setup Reference

```bash
# Start web in dev mode
cd competzy/web && npm run dev
# Runs on http://localhost:3000 (Next.js)
# Proxies /api/* to http://localhost:3000 (backend)

# Backend must also be running:
cd competzy/backend && npm run dev
# Runs on http://localhost:3000

# ⚠️ Web runs on port 3001 by default when backend is on 3000
# Check web/.env.local — BACKEND_URL should point to backend port
```

**Key files to know:**
- `web/lib/api/index.ts` — all API calls (edit this to add new endpoints)
- `web/lib/auth/context.tsx` — auth state (localStorage-based JWT)
- `web/components/Sidebar.tsx` — nav menu (add new routes here)
- `web/app/(dashboard)/layout.tsx` — auth guard + sidebar wrapper
- `web/next.config.ts` — API proxy config (points to backend)
